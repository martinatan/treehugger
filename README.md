Special thanks to the instructing staff of the Programming Usable Interfaces (05-630)
Fall 2021 course at Carnegie Mellon University. Sujeath, I appreciate your help
in showing me the basics of Three.JS and making this vision feel more attainable!

Other acknowledgements go out to the following resources that helped me envision what
I could do. Although I have not been able to put all of these features into play, they
have made me excited for future versions of this site.

- Transcriptions of scanned images from original installation
- Interactive components to represent each original entry
- Continuous playable audio from the original site for immersion
